# Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction

_The main goal of this research project is to develop an efficient algorithm for classifying drugs based on their biological activity._

## :book: About

The [Connectivity Map](https://clue.io/), a project within the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the [Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH)](https://lish.harvard.edu/), and the [NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)](https://lincsproject.org/), present this challenge with the goal of advancing drug development through improvements to MoA prediction algorithms.[[1]](#1)

>What is the Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug? And why is it important?

In pharmacology, the term mechanism of action (MOA) refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect.[[2]](#2) A mechanism of action usually includes mention of the specific molecular targets to which the drug binds, such as an enzyme or receptor.[[3]](#3)

In the past, scientists derived drugs from natural products or were inspired by traditional remedies. Very common drugs, such as paracetamol, known in the US as acetaminophen, were put into clinical use decades before the biological mechanisms driving their pharmacological activities were understood. Today, with the advent of more powerful technologies, drug discovery has changed from the serendipitous approaches of the past to a more targeted model based on an understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease. In this new framework, scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.

> How do we determine the MoAs of a new drug?

One approach is to treat a sample of human cells with the drug and then analyze the cellular responses with algorithms that search for similarity to known patterns in large genomic databases, such as libraries of gene expression ([GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home), etc.) or cell viability patterns of drugs with known MoAs.

As is customary, the dataset has been split into testing and training subsets. Hence, our task is to use the training dataset to develop an algorithm that automatically labels each case in the test set as one or more MoA classes. Note that since drugs can have multiple MoA annotations, the task is formally a multi-label classification problem.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Evaluation Metric

Based on the MoA annotations, the accuracy of solutions will be evaluated on the average value of the [logarithmic loss function](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview/evaluation) applied to each drug-MoA annotation pair.

## :floppy_disk: Dataset

In this challenge, we have an access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cells’ responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). In addition, we have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.

The training data has an additional (optional) set of MoA labels that are not included in the test data and not used for scoring.

In this competition, we need to predict multiple targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) response(s) of different samples (sig_id), given various inputs such as gene expression data and cell viability data.

**List of files:**

- `train_features.csv` - Features for the training set. Features g- signify gene expression data, and c- signify cell viability data. cp_type indicates samples treated with a compound (cp_vehicle) or with a control perturbation (ctrl_vehicle); control perturbations have no MoAs; cp_time and cp_dose indicate treatment duration (24, 48, 72 hours) and dose (high or low).
- `train_drug.csv` - This file contains an anonymous drug_id for the training set only.
- `train_targets_scored.csv` - The binary MoA targets that are scored.
- `train_targets_nonscored.csv` - Additional (optional) binary MoA responses for the training data. These are not predicted nor scored.
- `test_features.csv` - Features for the test data. You must predict the probability of each scored MoA for each row in the test data.
- `sample_submission.csv` - A submission file in the correct format.

### :inbox_tray: How to Get Data

Follow the next steps to access data:

1. Sign in to your [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account.
2. Accept [MoA competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/rules).
3. Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data) manually.
4. Unzip downloaded `lish_moa.zip` file to the `data/raw` project directory.

## :closed_lock_with_key: How to Use the Kaggle API

The project is integrated with the Kaggle API. When you run the `make data` command in your terminal, the script will automatically load the data set from Kaggle and extract it to the `data/raw` directory. But to make this possible, you must first configure your Kaggle API credentials.

Follow these steps to set up the Kaggle API credentials:

1. Create a new Kaggle API token, according to the [instructions](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication).
2. Save obtained `kaggle.json` file to the `~/.kaggle` folder.
   
> 📌 **Note:** If you need to store the Kaggle API token in an environment location, you must set the **KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR** environment variable to the path where you store the Kaggle API token **kaggle.json**. For example, on a Unix-based machine, the command would look like this:

```bash
    export KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/user/miniconda3/envs/moa/bin
```

For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not read access to your credentials: `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

You can also choose to export your Kaggle username and token to the environment:

```bash
    export KAGGLE_USERNAME=niander_wallace
    export KAGGLE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Follow the [documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) to learn more about the Kaggle API and how to use Kaggle CLI tools.
